# 3dmap
In this project, we try to make a very detailed 3d colored map using the infromation of the Lidar and Camera on a moving car. The goal of the project is to develop a strategy where the map is light enough to use it on a tablet and make it useable in a first and third person view mode.

## Goals
- [ ] 3D map using voxblox
- [ ] make map lighter by voxal collision
- [ ] colored map
- [ ] frontend map movement
- [ ] third person view of the map
- [ ] first person view of the map
